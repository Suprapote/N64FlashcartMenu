## Controller Paks

> [!WARNING]
> **THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL**

The N64FlashcartMenu has a Controller Pak Manager.

> [!WARNING]
> Mileage may vary when hot swapping paks without re-powering the console (and may contain incorrect content).

Features:
- Full pak backup and restore (saved to `SD:/cpak_saves/`).
- Partial pak ('note') backup and restore (saved to `SD:/cpak_saves/notes/`).

Use the "Controller Pak Manager" (accessed using `Start` button ) to backup and manage the pak.


Browse to the saved file (usually contained within `SD:/cpak_saves/`) to restore them.
